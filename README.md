## About

Grafana Distribution of [OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for Java] -
optimized for [Grafana Application Observability].

This project provides a Java agent JAR that can be attached to any Java 8+ application and dynamically
injects bytecode to capture telemetry from a number of popular libraries and frameworks.

Why use this distribution instead of [OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for Java] directly?

- **Easy to get started**: This distribution is optimized for [Grafana Application Observability] -
  you can get started with just a few environment variables.
- **Fully Compatible**: This distribution is fully compatible with [OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for Java] -
  you can use all configuration options of [OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for Java].
- **Optimized for Application Observability and Grafana Agent**: No need to tweak any configuration settings
  if you use the latest version of the Grafana Agent.
- **Fast Bug Fixes**: We can fix bugs faster without waiting for the next release of [OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for Java].
- **Cost Optimized**: You can save costs by sending only the metrics that are actually used by the dashboards in
  Application Observability ([opt-in](#data-saver)).
- **Easy to migrate**: Finally, rest assured that you can always
  [migrate](#migrating-to-opentelemetry-instrumentation-for-java) from this distribution to
  [OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for Java] at any time.
  
> **Open Source Friendly**:
>
> - You can use [OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for Java] directly for [Grafana Application Observability] -
>   this distribution is just a convenience wrapper.
>   You can find more information how to send telemetry data to Grafana Cloud Databases
>   [here](https://grafana.com/docs/opentelemetry/collector/send-otlp-to-grafana-cloud-databases/).
> - You can use this distribution for any OpenTelemetry use case, not just Grafana Cloud.
> - You can migrate from this distribution to OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for Java as explained
>   [here](#migrating-to-opentelemetry-instrumentation-for-java).

## Compatibility

- Java 8+
- We regularly update to the latest version of [OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for Java] - you can find the current
  version [here](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-opentelemetry-java/blob/main/build.gradle#L6)
- [Tested Libraries](examples/README.md)

## Getting Started

For production, we recommend to use [Grafana Agent], because Application Observability is optimized for it
(e.g. feature toggles).
[Opentelemetry Collector] is also supported for production use cases.

For an easier local development setup, send directly to Grafana Cloud OTLP Gateway.

### Grafana Cloud OTLP Gateway

> **Note**: The [Grafana Cloud OTLP Gateway](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/send-data/otlp/send-data-otlp/)
is a managed service that is available in all Grafana Cloud plans.

First, download the latest release of this distribution from the
[releases page](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-opentelemetry-java/releases).

Login to Grafana Cloud and follow the following instructions
to obtain the necessary information to send telemetry data to Grafana Cloud:

If you're just getting started with Grafana Cloud, you can
[sign up for permanent free plan](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/).

1. Click **Details** in the **Grafana** section on <https://grafana.com/profile/org>
2. Copy **Instance ID** and **Zone** into the command below.
3. On the left menu, click on **Security** and then on **API Keys**
4. Click on **Create API Key** (MetricsPublisher role) and copy the key into the command below
5. Choose a **Service Name** to identify the service (e.g. `cart`)
6. Optionally, add attributes to filter data:
   - **deployment.environment**: Name of the deployment environment (`staging` or `production`)
   - **service.namespace**: A namespace to group similar services
     (e.g. `shop` would create `shop/cart` in Application Observability)
   - **service.version**: The application version, to see if a new version has introduced a bug
   - **service.instance.id**: The unique instance, for example the Pod name (a UUID is generated by default)

Add the `-javaagent` option to the java command with the following environment variables:[^1].

```shell
export GRAFANA_CLOUD_INSTANCE_ID=<Instance ID>
export GRAFANA_CLOUD_ZONE=<Zone>
export GRAFANA_CLOUD_API_KEY=<Copied API Key>
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=<Service Name>
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=deployment.environment=<Environment>,service.namespace=<Namespace>,service.version=<Version>
java -javaagent:path/to/grafana-opentelemetry-java.jar -jar myapp.jar
```

Finally, make a few requests to the service to make sure it sends data to Grafana Cloud.
It might take up to a minute for data to appear.

**Important**: refer to the [troubleshooting guide](#troubleshooting) if there is no data in Application Observability.

### Grafana Agent

The Grafana Agent is a single binary that can be deployed as a sidecar or daemonset in Kubernetes,
or as a service in your network. It provides an endpoint where the application can send its telemetry data to.
The telemetry data is then forwarded to Grafana Cloud.

> **Important**: Skip this section and let the [OpenTelemetry Integration](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/data-configuration/integrations/integration-reference/integration-opentelemetry/)
> create everything for you.

First, download the latest release of this distribution from the
[releases page](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-opentelemetry-java/releases).

Login to Grafana Cloud and follow the following instructions to obtain the necessary information
to send telemetry data to Grafana Cloud:

If you're just getting started with Grafana Cloud, you can
[sign up for permanent free plan](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/).

1. If the Grafana Agent is not running locally or doesn't use the default grpc endpoint,
   adjust OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT or OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL.
2. Choose a **Service Name** to identify the service.
3. Optionally, add attributes to filter data:
   - **deployment.environment**: Name of the deployment environment (`staging` or `production`)
   - **service.namespace**: A namespace to group similar services
     (e.g. `shop` would create `shop/cart` in Application Observability)
   - **service.version**: The application version, to see if a new version has introduced a bug
   - **service.instance.id**: The unique instance, for example the Pod name (a UUID is generated by default)

Add the `-javaagent` option to the java command with the following environment variables:[^1].

```shell
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=<Service Name>
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=deployment.environment=<Environment>,service.namespace=<Namespace>,service.version=<Version>
java -javaagent:path/to/grafana-opentelemetry-java.jar -jar myapp.jar
```

The application will send data to the Grafana Agent. Please follow the
[Grafana Agent configuration for OpenTelemetry](https://grafana.com/docs/opentelemetry/instrumentation/configuration/grafana-agent/)
guide.

Finally, make a few requests to the service to make sure it sends data to Grafana Cloud.
It might take up to a minute for data to appear.

**Important**: refer to the [troubleshooting guide](#troubleshooting) if there is no data in Application Observability.

### OpenTelemetry Collector

First, download the latest release of this distribution from the
[releases page](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-opentelemetry-java/releases).

1. If the OpenTelemetry Collector is not running locally or doesn't use the default grpc endpoint,
   adjust OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT or OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL.
2. Choose a **Service Name** to identify the service.
3. Optionally, add attributes to filter data:
   - **deployment.environment**: Name of the deployment environment (`staging` or `production`)
   - **service.namespace**: A namespace to group similar services
     (e.g. `shop` would create `shop/cart` in Application Observability)
   - **service.version**: The application version, to see if a new version has introduced a bug
   - **service.instance.id**: The unique instance, for example the Pod name (a UUID is generated by default)

Add the `-javaagent` option to the java command with the following environment variables:[^1].

```shell
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=<Service Name>
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=deployment.environment=<Environment>,service.namespace=<Namespace>,service.version=<Version>
java -javaagent:path/to/grafana-opentelemetry-java.jar -jar myapp.jar
```

The application will send data to the OpenTelemetry Collector. Please follow the
[OpenTelemetry Collector configuration for OpenTelemetry](https://grafana.com/docs/opentelemetry/collector/send-otlp-to-grafana-cloud-databases/)
guide.

Finally, make a few requests to the service to make sure it sends data to Grafana Cloud.
It might take up to a minute for data to appear.

**Important**: refer to the [troubleshooting guide](#troubleshooting) if there is no data in Application Observability.

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see any data in [Grafana Application Observability], these are the most common causes:

### No Traffic

Make a few requests to the service to make sure it sends data to Grafana Cloud.

### Be Patient

Even after you've made a few requests, it can take a couple of minutes
until the data is visible in Application Observability.

### Look for errors

Look for errors - either on the console or in docker or Kubernetes logs
(using Application Observability logs doesn't make sense in this case).

If there are errors sending telemetry data, one of the parameters is usually wrong.
A 5xx response code means that there's something wrong with the [Grafana Cloud OTLP Gateway].

### Log all sent telemetry data

If there are not errors in the logs, make sure that the application is actually sending data all using
[debug logging](#enable-debug-logging).
If the application is not sending data, the java agent was probably not loaded - look for the `-javaagent` command line
parameter.

### Log telemetry data in Grafana Agent or OpenTelemetry Collector

If the application is sending data to a [Grafana Agent] or [OpenTelemetry Collector] instead of
[Grafana Cloud OTLP Gateway], make sure that there is no error forwarding the telemetry data.

### OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for Java troubleshooting guide

Finally, there is the
[troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation#troubleshooting)
of the upstream OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for Java.

## Community

To engage with the Grafana Application Observability community:

- Chat with us on our community Slack channel. To invite yourself to the
  Grafana Slack, visit [https://slack.grafana.com/](https://slack.grafana.com)
  and join the [#application-observability](https://grafana.slack.com/archives/C05E87XRK3J)
channel.
- Ask questions on the [Discussions page](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-opentelemetry-java/discussions).
- [File an issue](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-opentelemetry-java/issues/new)
  for bugs, issues, and feature suggestions.

## Reference

- In addition to the configuration explained above, you can use all system properties or environment variables from the
  [SDK auto-configuration](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure),
  which will take precedence.
- All exporters are set to `otlp` by default (even the logs exporter).

### Enable Debug Logging

Log all metrics, traces, and logs that are created for debugging purposes (in addition to sending them to the backend
via OTLP).

This will also send metrics and traces to Loki as an unintended side effect.

Add the following command line parameter:

```shell
export GRAFANA_OTLP_DEBUG_LOGGING=true
```

For more fine-grained control, you can also enable debug logging for specific signal types:

```shell
export GRAFANA_OTLP_LOGGING_EXPORTER_ENABLED="metrics,logs,traces"
```

The above would enable debug logging for all signal types (Note that order/case do not matter). If you only wish to
enable logging for specific signals, simply include those of interest in the list.

The following would only enable logging for metrics data.

```shell
export GRAFANA_OTLP_LOGGING_EXPORTER_ENABLED="metrics"
```

### Tested Instrumentations

This project provides end-to-end tests for a number of libraries. The tests are located in the `examples` folder and
are run by [oats](https://github.com/grafana/oats/). They cover the integration into the Grafana LTGM stack.

You can run the Grafana distribution in a mode that includes all instrumentation modules that are covered by the tests,
no more, no less.

```shell
export GRAFANA_OTEL_USE_TESTED_INSTRUMENTATIONS=true
```

These are the tested instrumentations:

### Data Saver

You can reduce metrics costs by turning off all metrics that are not used by the dashboards in
Application Observability.

```shell
export GRAFANA_OTEL_APPLICATION_OBSERVABILITY_METRICS=true
```

> **Note**: If you're creating metrics manually, you can enable them by setting the meter name to `application`.

The following metrics are currently (or planned to be) used by Application Observability:

| Metric                                     | Description                                                            |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| process.runtime.jvm.system.cpu.utilization | Used in the JVM tab in Application Observability                       |
| process.runtime.jvm.memory.usage           | Used in the JVM tab in Application Observability                       |
| process.runtime.jvm.memory.limit           | Used in the JVM tab in Application Observability                       |
| process.runtime.jvm.gc.duration            | Used in the JVM tab in Application Observability                       |
| process.runtime.jvm.classes.current_loaded | Used in the JVM tab in Application Observability                       |
| process.runtime.jvm.threads.count          | Used in the JVM tab in Application Observability                       |
| db.client.connections.usage                | Used in [JDBC dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/19732) |

### Migrating to OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for Java

Follow these steps if you want to migrate from this distribution to the upstream project
OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for Java:

- Replace all environment variables or system properties with the "grafana" prefix as explained
  [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/send-data/otlp/send-data-otlp/#push-directly-from-applications-using-the-opentelemetry-sdks).
- Add the `service.instance.id` to the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`, e.g. `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.instance.id=<pod123>,deployment.environment=...`
  where `<pod123>` it the name of the Kubernetes pod or some other unique identifier within the service
  (future versions of OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for Java might include this feature).
- If you use [Data Saver](#data-saver), you can filter the metrics in the OpenTelemetry Collector instead
  ([docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/transforming-telemetry/#basic-filtering)).
  The Data Saver section lists all metrics to keep.
- The resource detectors for Kubernetes (for EKS and GKE) are not bundled in OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for Java.
  You can get the same and more resource attributes using the OpenTelemetry collector
  ([docs](https://grafana.com/docs/opentelemetry/collector/enriching-attributes-in-cloud/#adding-kubernetes-resource-attributes)).
- Add the environment variables below for the best experience with Application Observability:

```shell
export OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN=http
export OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_MICROMETER_BASE_TIME_UNIT=s
export OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_LOG4J_APPENDER_EXPERIMENTAL_LOG_ATTRIBUTES=true
export OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_LOGBACK_APPENDER_EXPERIMENTAL_LOG_ATTRIBUTES=true 
```

    System properties can be used instead of environment variables, for example
    `-Dotel.service.name=<OTEL_SERVICE_NAME>` instead of `export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=<OTEL_SERVICE_NAME>`.
