# Overview

Example projects for redis clients.

## Running the examples

See the [examples README](../README.md#running-the-examples).

## Metrics

The jedis driver exposes metrics via JMX. These metrics can be exported independently of spring boot -
see otel-jmx-config.yaml - which is used in the oats tests.
