# Releasing

## Preparing a Release

Make sure that there is a recent Pull Request with the "oats" label that has been merged into the `main` branch.
This will ensure that the release is tested against the OATS test suite.

## Create a Release

1. Go to <https://github.com/grafana/grafana-opentelemetry-java/releases>
2. Click on "Choose a tag", enter the tag name (e.g. `v0.1.0`), and click "Create a new tag".
3. Click on "Generate release notes" to auto-generate the release notes based on the commits since the last release.
4. Click on "Publish release".
